# **Hey there. I'm AbnerSquared.**
In my free time, I like to program cool methods, concepts, and ideas that come to mind on a random every day basis.
Back in 2018, all of those ideas came together to help create Orikivo, a Discord bot written with Discord.Net with the goal to create a unique experience.

## What else do you work on besides Orikivo?
When I'm not working on Orikivo, I tend to draw quite a bit, plan new ideas out for a future game, study repositories, documentation, and code to learn how to improve myself every day.

### Anything else?
As of now, I don't have much to say. However, if I think of a cool idea, I'll be here, coding away if you need me.
