# **Hey there. I'm AbnerSquared.**
In my free time, I like to program cool methods, concepts, and ideas that come to mind on a random every day basis.
Back in 2018, all of those ideas came together to help create Orikivo, a Discord bot written with Discord.Net with the goal to create a unique experience.

## What else do you work on besides Orikivo?
When I'm not working on Orikivo, I tend to draw quite a bit, plan new ideas out for a future game, study repositories, documentation, and code to learn how to improve myself every day. I'm also in the process of posting old projects for others to freely reference every week.

### Anything else?
As of now, I don't have much to say. However, if I think of a cool idea, I'll be here, coding away if you need me.

> **Web Portal**

[**Ko-Fi**](https://ko-fi.com/abnersquared): I'll be attempting to make this my primary location for developer logs.

[**Orikivo Community Server**](https://discord.gg/387Axar): This is the main server at which I test and work on Orikivo on a daily basis.

[**Orikivo's Website**](https://abnersquared.github.io/Orikivo.Web/): This is currently outdated, but is in the progress of being rewritten. Stay tuned!
